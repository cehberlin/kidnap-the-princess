=instructions=
  * put new work and bugs into "TODO"
    * please prioritize the new work (more important work should be at the start of the list)
  * if you work on something put it under "in progress"
  * after finishing the work out it in "done"
  * before creating new classes take a look into the architecture document, bigger or tricky constructs should be documented in that document
  * check the design document before you implement so we implement our collective vision, if something is not clear please write a email 


= in Progress =

  * Class Ingredients -> John
  * 


= TODO =
== WORK FOR ALPHA VERSION ==
  * Leveleditor: FileName: level<worldnr>_<levelnr>_<flag>
    * available spells in layer
    * enemy in editor: put graphic in editor on enemy layer  
  * First Level
  * all spells implemented like described in the design document (graphics not important, only mechanics)
    * aiming mechanics -> christopher
    * correcting fire/freeze/noGravity/createMatter (add aiming etc)
    * push / pull
    * electricity

  === OPTIONAL (if enough time is left) ===
  * elements that are influenced by push/pull
  * turn music/sound on/off 
  * BUG: spell HUD do not change after level reload if you switch the spells


== WORK FOR BETA VERSION ==
  * Sound menu (turn sound and/or music on/off)
  * menu exit -> exit game should be last entry
  * level: mechanics for switches in levels (see level ideas in design document)
  * savegames 
  * save configuration (save settings like sound/resolutions)
  * enemy / AI 
    * shadow creature -> follows player if he is near him
    * bats: flying through level (sinus curve)
    * spide: only moves in defined web area (in all directions)
  


==work until next milestone ==
  * reimplementation of last prototype state, 
    * write down which class you are working on
      * if you build a component, create the class and submit before writing code in it
    * for decoupled components you can provide a minimal implementation or copy paste from the last prototype first (can be replaced later by better component implementation)

   * encapsulate important constants from all classes in some static classes as static changeable values (no const)
   * clean code wherever necessary 
  * let camera follow the player (needs fine tuning)
  * maybe let us think about a resolution independent implementation
    ( I recently tried this with our old prototype http://www.david-amador.com/2010/03/xna-2d-independent-resolution-rendering/ ) But I had problems with the cameraposition ..
  * online edit possebility for constants (Marian already working?)
  * draw zero layer
  

==work for next milestone==

 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player.
 * Stop playing the background music when exiting the GamePlayScreen.
 * Menu Entry for Options should be in the middle and the Quit Option at the bottom.
 * Enable multilined SpriteSheets. (Highly optional: Eable spritesheets with more than one animation.)
 * Put Debug Controls also into a nencapsulated interface
 * Enemy different behavior and general ki (old one was disabled, because is buggy)
 * fix bounds of player and enemy --> complete wrong

== deferred work ==


= done =
Implementation Player and removing tile stuff --> Christopher

Menu screens: creating the menus --> Amauri
   * changed Spell stuff (creation,constant management, etc)
   * new controls -> Marian
   * reimplement matter --> Christopher
   * fix bug with plattforms --> Christopher
These both are done by Marian?? I think its finished in term of coding, but please change the keys ;-)
   * encapsulate controls, see or copy implementation from new started architecture to old one
   * implement new control style?
   * Rework animation class -> Pascal
Christopher:
  * bounds fix
  * collision resolution 
  * create matter: player is directly throwing block after casting
  * Check the collision resolution class and bounds of pplatforms and enemies. -> Flickering enemey bug + Teleporting player.
  * Better fitting animation for new matter spell
