== Final (13.07) ==
  # BUG: push/pull moves Matter through walls --> seems to be fixed for push pull elements; maybe still a problem for selfcreated matter, but that maybe not fixable at the moment --> still a bug for created matter 
  # Sounds for: REPLACE or ADD better fitting FREE sounds and music --> all (use dropbox to collect all sounds. At the end team will decide which to use) [tipps http://www.freesound.org/ http://www.sounddogs.com/)
     * backgroung music --> make music.mp3 loopabel --> Amauri
     * torch goes on/off
     * switch goes on/off
     * sound for no_gravity -> may cut and loop the file
no_gravity_is_running.mp3 --> Amauri
     * add SoundType.rockslide to spell moveable and switch moveable platforms as loop during movement, dont know where adding the call --> John
     * be creative finding more sounds...!!!
  # BUG: aiming aid. warm and cold spell sometimes draw twice. (happens with game pad)
  # Hide background color(blue) of levels at the edge --> may use of some big textures
  # KEYPAD MAPPING 
  # enhace menus appareance --> amauri
     * make messagebox convenient to menu design, also check text
  # Manual
  # 5 Screenshots, Groupname, Game Description
  # presentation plan
  # Screen to play the film --> Amauri
  # BUG: bad linebreak in instructions
  # better push/pull spell graphic
  # BUG: different display solutions: evrything else then 800x600 shows parts of the level that shouldnt beet visible, so rescale the picture in a way that each resolution is showing the same image section or remove the different resolutions
  # improve/rewrite controls menu -> amauri


 === optional ===
  # Draw 3D level exit -> Pascal
  # better boundings: big blockades have an ugly bounding box
  # Bigger and better "wall" textures -> Pascal
  # startgame - story from game (pictures or aimation)
  # button for spell under the rune in the HUD
  # show level in background in the level selection screen


== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.

Nicht mehr so wichtig wegen Zeit:
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions) --> John
