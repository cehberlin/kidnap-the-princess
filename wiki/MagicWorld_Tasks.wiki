  * put new work and bugs into "TODO"
    * please prioritize the new work (more important work should be at the start of the list)
  * if you work on something put it under "in progress"
  * after finishing the work out it in "done"
  * before creating new classes take a look into the architecture document, bigger or tricky constructs should be documented in that document

==work until next milestone ==
  * reimplementation of last prototype state, 
    * write down which class you are working on
      * if you build a component, create the class and submit before writing code in it
    * for decoupled components you can provide a minimal implementation or copy paste from the last prototype first (can be replaced later by better component implementation)
