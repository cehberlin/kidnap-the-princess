== Final (13.07) ==
  # BUG: push/pull bounding bounding box--> Where is the bug?its correct in my opinion!
  # Sounds for: REPLACE or ADD better fitting FREE sounds and music --> all (use dropbox to collect all sounds. At the end team will decide which to use) [tipps http://www.freesound.org/ http://www.sounddogs.com/)
     * jumping
     * dying
     * level complete
     * spell casting
     * backgroung music
     * ingredient collected
     * spell hit enemy
     * menu sound
     * laughter if enemy is killd by icicle
  # new rune texture for fire -> Pascal
  # BUG: Push and pull does not work correct -> Is depended of position of player in contrast to influenced object if a spell works as push or pull --> not sure maybe I am confused with the icons
  # BUG: aiming aid. warm and cold spell sometimes draw twice. (happens with game pad)
  # switch feedback - show that switch is activated (weigth switch & electricity)
  # KEYPAD MAPPING
  # Draw 3D level exit -> Pascal
  # enhace menus appareance --> amauri
     * make messagebox convenient to menu design, also check text
  # Better looking torch texture -> Pascal
  # Another texture for moveable platforms -> Pascal
  # Manual
  # 5 Screenshots, Groupname, Game Description
  # presentation plan
  # optional: highlight objects that are infuenced by push/pull while casting
  # optional: startgame - story from game (pictures or aimation)
  # optional: HUD ELements nicht so nahe am Bildschirmrand
  # optional: button for spell under the rune in the HUD
  # optional: show level in background in the level selection screen


 === optional ===
  # better boundings: big blockades have an ugly bounding box
  # you should move with moveable plattforms -->rounding problem?? (Also: while casting on the platform the player no longer moves with a platform)
  # optimize platform textures -> Pascal
  # Bigger and better "wall" textures -> Pascal



== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.

Nicht mehr so wichtig wegen Zeit:
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions) --> John
  # make magic influenceabel objects like push pull objects visible by color, unique texture or special effect->Pascal (I would draw another texture, is that fine with you guys?) solved by colorizing
