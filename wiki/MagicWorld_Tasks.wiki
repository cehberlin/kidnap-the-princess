  == Beta (29.06) ==

  == pre Final (06.07) ==
  # BUG: If you exit the running game from pause menu you got an exception
  # shrink animation of push pull -> necessary because we cant shrink so much, because run into problems with float precision. --> pascal
  # make difference for push pull with color --> pascal
  # REPLACE or ADD better fitting FREE sounds and music --> john
  # enhace menus appareance --> amauri
  # level with icecle (only pass enemy by killing it with icecle)  -> *???*
  # level textures -> Pascal
    * vulcano
    * one texture for ever switch type
    * rope or chain
  # animation for no gravity -> Pascal
  # fix behavior if you reach last level -> show congratulation and finish screen, show credits and continue to main menu --> Amauri
     * Show which button to press, also add JUMP-Key (NOT ONLY ENTER)
  # give magican another wand and put every wand in one animation ->Pascal
  # check level 7 if the new door implementation works like expected with level idea --> I think its Johns Level --> Check it! ->John
  # track textures -> Pascal asks: As in mine cart tracks? Dont know you and John talked about tracks for moveable platforms, I only added this task.(christopher)  
  # effect/bug shadow creatures push created matter. is this wanted?
  # tuorial levels: planning for the first levels with instructions to learn game mechanic (level 1-3) -> Pascal
  # screen for choosing level (showing statistics for each level and show level in background)
    * accessible from pause mode

== Final (13.07) ==
  # BUG: big blockades have an ugly bounding box
  # BUG: game exit throws exception
  # Reset Game profile
  # Iceblock instead of color change when freezing a bat

 === optional ===
  # you should move with moveable plattforms -->rounding problem?? (Also: while casting on the platform the player no longer moves with a platform)



== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.

Nicht mehr so wichtig wegen Zeit:
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions) --> John
  # make magic influenceabel objects like push pull objects visible by color, unique texture or special effect->Pascal (I would draw another texture, is that fine with you guys?) solved by colorizing
