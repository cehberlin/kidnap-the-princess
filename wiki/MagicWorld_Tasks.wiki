  # BUG: push/pull moves Matter through walls --> seems to be fixed for push pull elements; maybe still a problem for selfcreated matter, but that maybe not fixable at the moment --> still a bug for created matter 
  # BUG: If you use Pull to an Pull Object and use ist afterward again and hold the button while object is moving, the object still moves.
  # Sounds for: REPLACE or ADD better fitting FREE sounds and music --> all (use dropbox to collect all sounds. At the end team will decide which to use) [tipps http://www.freesound.org/ http://www.sounddogs.com/)

== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.
