  # BUG: push/pull moves Matter through walls
  # show intro video in game

     * jumping
     * dying
     * level complete
     * spell casting
     * backgroung music
     * ingredient collected
     * spell hit enemy

  # BUG: If you play 2 levels the number of Ingredients is wrong
  # Level 3 put the stones in the moat to foreground layer --> Pascal
  # Audiomanager -> John
  # BUG: aiming aid. warm and cold spell sometimes draw twice. (happens with game pad)
  # Hide background color(blue) of levels at the edge --> may use of some big textures
  # KEYPAD MAPPING
  # Draw 3D level exit -> Pascal
  # enhace menus appareance --> amauri

  # Manual
  # 5 Screenshots, Groupname, Game Description
  # presentation plan
  # optional: highlight objects that are infuenced by push/pull while casting



 === optional ===
  # better boundings: big blockades have an ugly bounding box
  # Bigger and better "wall" textures -> Pascal
  # startgame - story from game (pictures or aimation)
  # HUD ELements nicht so nahe am Bildschirmrand
  # button for spell under the rune in the HUD
  # show level in background in the level selection screen
  # Adjust levels with old platforms and adjust value responisble for the "player ground sinking"


== rejected To Dos ==
 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player. -> This will be solved by placing impassable items at the left and right bounds so the player can't touch the. Also no platform will be put so high that the player can reach the top.

Nicht mehr so wichtig wegen Zeit:
  # spider: only moves in defined web area (in all directions) --> John
