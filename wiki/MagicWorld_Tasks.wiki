  * put new work and bugs into "TODO"
    * please prioritize the new work (more important work should be at the start of the list)
  * if you work on something put it under "in progress"
  * after finishing the work out it in "done"
  * before creating new classes take a look into the architecture document, bigger or tricky constructs should be documented in that document
  * check the design document before you implement so we implement our collective vision, if something is not clear please write a email 


= in Progress =

Class: LevelObject(for non tile drawing) and LevelEditor --> John



= TODO =
==work until next milestone ==
  * reimplementation of last prototype state, 
    * write down which class you are working on
      * if you build a component, create the class and submit before writing code in it
    * for decoupled components you can provide a minimal implementation or copy paste from the last prototype first (can be replaced later by better component implementation)

   * encapsulate important constants from all classes in some static classes as static changeable values (no const)
   * encapsulate controls, see or copy implementation from new started architecture to old one
   * implement new control style?
   * reimplement matter
   * fix bug with plattforms
   * clean code wherever necessary 
    
  

==work for next milestone==



== deferred work ==
