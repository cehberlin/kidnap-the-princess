=instructions=
  * put new work and bugs into "TODO"
    * please prioritize the new work (more important work should be at the start of the list)
  * if you work on something put it under "in progress"
  * after finishing the work out it in "done"
  * work on phase 1 problems first

= in Progress =
  * matter spell casting
    * created matter needs to fall down after casting -->christopher
  * no gravitation spell -> gravitation should influence created matter (if it is falling down)  -->christopher




= TODO =
==PHASE 1 - core mechanics/game elements ==
  * player controls
    * other key for jump (up key should set direction for spell and for floating in no gravity area)
  * General game mechanics
    * score and time should always be on the upper left corner of the screen
    * Message Popup should be shown in the middle of the screen


==PHASE 2 - playable prototype ==
  * Mana implementation (manabar on overlay, diffrent castig cost for bigger spell, balanced mana regeneration)
  * standing on top of froozen enemies 
  * icicle (falls down when hit by warming spell and kills enemys that got hit by the icicle)
  * levels to show diffrent combinations of spells
    * matter + gravitation spell
    * caging an enemy
    * kill enemy with icicle -> exit door opens (or enemy leaves a key)
    * 


==PHASE 3 - fine tuning / extra stuff ==
  * no gravity spell -> player must be able to move in all directions in spell sphere (like swimming)
  * background graphics
  * character graphics
  * no gravitation graphics
  * casted spells weakens with time (gets smaller/ fading out slowly)
  * elapsed time on overlay 
  * level balancing
  * frozen tiles change movement for player and enemies




= done =
  * additional ice tile (ice tile can be destroyed with fire)
  * matter spell seems to crash the game once in a while --> John
  * spells shouldnt move if they being casted while not moving --> John
  * spell moving in directon of movement --> John
  * matter spell -->christopher
  * gravity spell --> Marian
  * warming and freezing enemies 
  * implemented moving camera
  * improving project structure - Marian
  * enemy impl - AI --> John
    - Enemy moves towards the player
  * spell moving in drecton of movement (also up and down) --> John
  * picture for frozen enemies  -->christopher
  * spell impl general stuff - Amauri --> Continued Christopher: BASICS ARE DONE
  * matter should be created directly not after hitting something
 (casting direction is like throwing the created block) --> christopher: creates tile after fly time is over or after collision a flying tile is problematic in this tiled game world, but current implementation should fit our needs
