  * put new work and bugs into "TODO"
    * please prioritize the new work (more important work should be at the start of the list)
  * if you work on something put it under "in progress"
  * after finishing the work out it in "done"
  * before creating new classes take a look into the architecture document, bigger or tricky constructs should be documented in that document
  * check the design document before you implement so we implement our collective vision, if something is not clear please write a email 


= in Progress =

  * Hud completion -> Pascal
  * Class Ingredients -> John


= TODO =
==work until next milestone ==
  * reimplementation of last prototype state, 
    * write down which class you are working on
      * if you build a component, create the class and submit before writing code in it
    * for decoupled components you can provide a minimal implementation or copy paste from the last prototype first (can be replaced later by better component implementation)

   * encapsulate important constants from all classes in some static classes as static changeable values (no const)
   * clean code wherever necessary 
  * Better fitting animation for new matter spell 
  * let camera follow the player
  * maybe let us think about a resolution independent implementation
    ( I recently tried this with our old prototype http://www.david-amador.com/2010/03/xna-2d-independent-resolution-rendering/ ) But I had problems with the cameraposition ..
  * online edit possebility for constants (Marian already working?)
    
  

==work for next milestone==

 * Implement different level bound behavior: Top, left, right are like bumping into an object while the bottom kills the player.
 * Stop playing the background music when exiting the GamePlayScreen.

== deferred work ==


= done =
Implementation Player and removing tile stuff --> Christopher

Menu screens: creating the menus --> Amauri
   * changed Spell stuff (creation,constant management, etc)
   * new controls -> Marian
   * reimplement matter --> Christopher
   * fix bug with plattforms --> Christopher
These both are done by Marian?? I think its finished in term of coding, but please change the keys ;-)
   * encapsulate controls, see or copy implementation from new started architecture to old one
   * implement new control style?
